### Keep doing:
- Work by organizing the tasks through Jira. By this way it is clear who performs each task and the delivery times.
- Gitflow methodology to manage branches, merge and pull request so that everyone can work on their own functionality.
- Weekly meetings (zoom) "planning" in which the topics of the sprint are seen and the tasks are hierarchized and divided.
- Implementation of agile methodology using Jira.
- Learn tools/concepts needed to do the development.

### Start doing:
- Set design limits and reasonable scopes. Functionalities were developed that may have been outside the desired scope.
- Estimate tasks using the Fibonacci series.
- Estimate the right time for each new feature.
- Better understanding in the use of pull requests.
- Document the work done.

- Be up to date with Wireframe concepts.
