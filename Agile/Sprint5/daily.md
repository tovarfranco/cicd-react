## Daily/planning/weekely:

### Things done:
- Create folder structure for users (CRUD)
- Register form for users.
- Login form created for users.
- Use of cookies.
- Use of express-validator for forms.
- The Jira board was made with the different tasks, divided into front-end and back-end, again.
- Each member was assigned a story.
- Development of the functionalities.

### Things to do:
- Use models structure to separate controller and DB connection.
- Confirmation page for actions.
- Test field disabled to edit.
- Scope analysis.
- Estimate time for future modifications.
- Test the developed website to find "bugs".

### Blockers:
- Modification of HTML for user loggued. We had to rewrite the HTML code/ejs in order to have the user image and name. We needed that first because the middleware routes didn't work (unlogged users could navigate in our entire website).
