## Daily/planning/weekely:

### Things done:
- DER Develop.
- DER Implementation using Sequelize.
- CRUD methods (Sequelize).
- Create endpoints.
- Custom methods.

### Things to do:
- Use models structure to separate controller and DB connection.
- Confirmation page for actions.
- Test field disabled to edit.
- Estimate time for future modifications.
- Test the developed website to find "bugs".

### Blockers:
- We had to create the DER first in order to implement the Sequelize feature in our project. That part took some time to make it work.
