## Daily/planning/weekely:

### Things done:
- Learn MVC, and EJS concepts.
- The Jira board was made with the different tasks, divided into front-end and back-end, again.
- Each member was assigned a story.
- Development of the functionalities.

### Things to do:
- Analyze different improvements or changes in the website.
- Scope analysis.
- Estimate time for future modifications.
- Test the developed website to find "bugs".

### Blockers:
- Catch up the theory material to develop the requirement. That took some time because we had to learn the main concepts first, then implement them in the sprint.
